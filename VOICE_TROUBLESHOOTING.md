# üé§ Voice Recognition Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Network Error Fix**

### **Problem**: "Network error. Please check your connection."

The Web Speech API requires an internet connection to work because it uses Google's speech recognition servers.

### ‚úÖ **Solutions**:

1. **Check Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Test other websites to confirm connectivity

2. **Browser Settings**
   - **Chrome**: Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone` and allow microphone access
   - **Edge**: Go to `edge://settings/content/microphone` and allow microphone access
   - **Safari**: Check Safari > Preferences > Websites > Microphone

3. **Firewall/Network Issues**
   - Some corporate networks block Web Speech API
   - Try using a different network (mobile hotspot)
   - Check if your firewall is blocking speech services

4. **HTTPS Requirement**
   - Web Speech API only works on HTTPS sites
   - `localhost` works for development
   - Ensure your production site uses HTTPS
